# [Click here to view the website](https://talanplayz.github.io/wordlecloneweb/public/index.html)
Yes, this is another Wordle clone. This one has:
 - 3-7 length words
 - 3-9 guesses
 - Dynamic light/dark mode
 - Word sharing
 - Virtual keyboard
 - Custom daily words
 - Statistics
 - Dynamic game board sizing

This is my first ever big web project using a framework, Svelte.

## Compiling yourself
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
3. Run either `npm run dev` to run a hot-reload localhost site, or `npm run build` to compile the code into HTML and JS.

## Word list
A full list of words can be found in `/wordfinder/words.ts`. It is taken from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeisler/scrabble/master/db/dictionary.csv) and is from the scrabble dictionary.
